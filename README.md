## Project : Website Scrapping 

### Program : Python, Beautiful Soup, Jupyter Notebook

Overview: This two part project consits of 1: Scarping data from the Mars News website and 2. Scraping and analyzing the Mars Weather Data website. 

The first part of this project utilized the splinter and beautiful soup libraries to scrape the text elements of the Mars News website to find and store the title of each article as well as the summary of each article. 

The second part of this project involved scarping the Mars Weather Data website which contained a table of data gathered by the Curiosity rover. Once the table is scraped, a pandas dataframe is created to analyze the data and answer the following questions:

- How many months exist on Mars?
- How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
- What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 
- Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 
- Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
- About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? 

Issues: While working on this project, I ran into path issue with Matplotlib and Pandas. The resolution was to update python.
